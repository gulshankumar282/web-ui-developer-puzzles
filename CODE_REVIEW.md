1. Inside the libs -->books --> where all the states are defined all the action should be defined as constant so that whenever we need to change the name of that action we can change in only one place and reflects in all the places. - FIXED

2. There must be pagination to render the list of books it will increase the performance of application. - FIXED

3. Image of all the listed books should be equal in size and not random of any size.

4. UI should be better when displaying the search result.






## Accessiblity Issues:

# Automated
1. Buttons do not have an accessible name. When a button doesn't have an accessible name, screen readers announce it as "button", making it unusable for users who rely on screen readers.

# Manual
2. Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read.
